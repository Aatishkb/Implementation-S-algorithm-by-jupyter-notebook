# S-Algorithm-Implementation-by-jupyter-notebook.

* The find-S algorithm is a basic concept learning algorithm in machine learning. The find-S algorithm finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all the positive examples. We have to note here that the 
  algorithm considers only those positive training example.
  
* This algorithm only uses positive examples(Yes) for prediction whether he can go out to play tennis or not and ignores the rest of the examples.
